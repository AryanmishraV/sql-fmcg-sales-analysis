## Dashboard Note

This project intentionally focuses on **SQL-first business analysis**.

Dashboards are treated as a **presentation layer** and can be built once
the data model and business logic are finalized.

The queries in `queries.sql` are directly designed to feed tools like
Power BI or Tableau for dashboard creation.
